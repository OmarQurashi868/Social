This is my second React project where I decided to use TypeScript instead of JavaScript to learn more about the language.
# What is the project about?
Initially, I didn't have a solid idea about what exactly the project is going to be, but I was leaning towards some sort of social media/blog type of website just to experiment with the format.
# What features are implemented/planned?
Account system
Publishing posts
Tags system for categorizing posts
Search system (By user, content or tags)
Loading states for transitions
Image support for post banners and in-content
Likes and comments system

I am also undecided on whether I should add a live chat system and a forum/space system.
# What is the goal of the project?
Ultimately, this project is just another step towards becoming a better programmer and web developer. I don't plan on releasing, selling or marketting this project nor do I expect it to blow up or anything like that. Feedback, pull requests, questions...etc are all welcome.
